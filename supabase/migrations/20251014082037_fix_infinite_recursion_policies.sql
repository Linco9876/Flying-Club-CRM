  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - Policies on users table were checking the users table, causing infinite recursion
    - This happened with "Admins can read all users", "Instructors can read students", etc.

  2. Solution
    - Drop all existing policies on users table
    - Create new policies that don't reference the users table recursively
    - Use a simplified approach where we allow authenticated users to read all users
    - Restrict writes to only admins/instructors (which we'll enforce in the application layer)
    - For production, role should be stored in auth.jwt() metadata

  3. Security
    - All authenticated users can read user data (needed for the app to function)
    - Users can update their own records
    - Users can insert records with their own ID (for signup)
    - Application layer enforces admin/instructor restrictions

-- Drop all existing policies on users table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own data" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own data" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Instructors can read students" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own record" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins and instructors can update users" ON users;

-- Create simplified policies that don't cause recursion

-- Allow all authenticated users to read users (needed for app functionality)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read all users"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Allow users to insert their own record (for signup)
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own user record"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow users to update their own record
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own user record"
  ON users
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow deletion only of own record
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own user record"
  ON users
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = id);
