/*
  # Fix All Recursive RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - Many tables have policies that check the users table, causing recursion
    
  2. Solution
    - Replace all recursive policies with simplified versions
    - Allow authenticated users broad access
    - Rely on application layer for role-based restrictions
    
  3. Security
    - RLS still protects data from unauthenticated access
    - Application enforces role-based access control
    - For production, consider using auth.jwt() for role checks
