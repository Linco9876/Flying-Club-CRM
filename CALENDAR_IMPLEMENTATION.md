- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Focus indicators on all interactive components
- Screen reader friendly structure
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44px minimum)

### 4. Enhanced Booking Form (`src/components/Bookings/BookingForm.tsx`)

#### Dynamic Field Configuration
- Fields display based on admin settings
- Role-based field requirements
- Real-time validation
- Loading states during data fetch

#### Smart Defaults
- Pre-fills date/time from calendar click
- Pre-selects resource from context
- Auto-populates pilot for student users

#### Enhanced Validation
- Date/time range validation
- Aircraft availability checks
- End time must be after start time
- Required field validation by role
- Custom error messages per field

#### Real Data Integration
- Pilot dropdown shows all users from database
- Instructor dropdown shows only users with instructor role
- Aircraft dropdown shows all aircraft with rates and status
- Payment type options
- Notes field with rich text support planned

### 5. Admin Settings Panel (`src/components/Settings/BookingFieldSettings.tsx`)

#### Field Configuration Interface
- Table view of all booking form fields
- Toggle required/visible status
- Role-based application (admin, instructor, student)
- Inline editing with save/cancel actions
- Real-time preview of changes

#### Features
- Drag-to-reorder fields (planned)
- Custom help text per field

- Focus management
- ARIA labels and roles
- High contrast mode support

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of calendar views
- Memoized calculations
- Efficient date range queries
- Optimistic UI updates
- Loading states and skeleton screens

## User Experience Enhancements

### Navigation
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys for date navigation)
- Touch gestures for mobile (swipe to change date)
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Back to today button

### Visual Design
- Color-coded booking statuses
- Resource type indicators (icons)
- Availability shading
- Hover tooltips with booking details
- Smooth transitions between views

### Responsive Design
